Recent approaches have explored language-guided classifiers capable of classifying examples from novel tasks when provided with task-specific natural language explanations, instructions or prompts (Sanh et al., 2022; R. Menon et al., 2022; Brown et al., 2020). While these classifiers can generalize in zero-shot settings, the task performance often varies substantially between the language explanations in unpredictable ways (Lu et al., 2022; Gonen et al., 2022). Also, current approaches donâ€™t leverage unlabeled examples of a task that may be available in many scenarios. Here, we introduce TALC, a framework that leverages data programming to adapt a language-guided classifier for a novel task during inference when given access to explanations from multiple teachers and unlabeled test examples. Our results show that TALC consistently outperforms a competitive baseline from prior work by an impressive 9.3% (relative improvement). Furthermore, we showcase the robustness of TALC to variations in the quality and quantity of provided explanations, indicating its potential in scenarios involving learning from multiple teachers or a crowd.
