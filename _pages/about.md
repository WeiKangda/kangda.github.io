Howdy, I am a first-year PhD student in the [Natural Language Processing Group](https://nlp.cs.tamu.edu) at Texas A&M University, where I am advised by Professor [Ruihong Huang](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/huangrh/index.html). Before becoming an Aggie, I graduated with a BS/MS degree in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I was advised by Professor [Shashank Srivastava](https://www.ssriva.com).

My research interests center on interpretable machine learning and natural language processing.
